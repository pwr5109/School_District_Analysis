# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the project
The school board requested to analyze the school district after changing the grades in one of the schools. We are looking for how the changed grades affected the averages in the district, how it compares averages among the district/school based on metrics. 

## Results
Here are the results of our analysis:
-	The replaced the grades of cheating students was ran the analysis again and we can see that THS has dropped by approximately 0.3 point.
-	We noticed that schools with smaller budgets per student had better results than ones with bigger budgets
-	We notice that Medium size schools perform a lot better than other size schools, based on all analysis and charts.
-	THS dropped between 0.01 and 0.03 points on all average numbers, while the same type schools stayed unchanged
By looking at the analysis I can conclude that Math and Reading scores are affected negatively by replacing the scores and dropped points. 

## Summary
After having done the analysis, I can see the negative change in both the Math and the Reading scores was due to the changing of the ninth-grade scores, which resulted in changing the results for all other schools in district. One of the challenging parts of this project was using the .loc and I was able to look up resources and test every method to get a correct result.
